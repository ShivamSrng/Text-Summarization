Apart from RM, BTS also features Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. In an interview with Hypebeast, RM said, ""This is the most difficult question to answer truthfully. Recently, I watched Everything Everywhere All At Once. That film visualized many of the ideas that I have had, such as the idea about multiple versions of myself existing based on small choices I made. I often think about what it would have been like if I continued my studies or became something other than a musician."" ""To be honest, one decision that I had often thought about was my choice to become a part of a boy band. In the late 2000s, musicians like Zico, Changmo, and Giriboy were the people that I started out with. In my journey with BTS, I drifted further and further away from that world and was tormented by the thought that the people that I liked – and the people who enjoyed the same music as I – did not have any love for me. I often wondered whether I made the right decision by joining a boy band. At the time, BTS, was treated like a complete outsider in the Korean hip-hop community. That stressed me out. I was constantly thinking about how I would be able to overcome that perception and how to define music or hip-hop,” he added. RM released his first solo mixtape in 2015. Three years later, he released his second mixtape, Mono.

62,"BTS leader RM and his agency Big Hit Music shut down claims suggesting that RM is dating someone. The rumours stemmed from a YouTube video posted on Thursday. As reported by Soompi, a video claimed that the BTS leader was dating a woman of his same age. The channel also claimed that he has been in a relationship with her since 2019. Big Hit on Friday issued a statement clarifying the claims. “The dating rumours involving RM are not true,” the agency said. Shortly after, RM took to Weverse and clarified his stand as well. “I do not know the person at all and the poodle is my friend's poodle,” he wrote on Weverse, as translated by BTS fan account @BTStranslation_ on Twitter. The speculation comes shortly after the agency had to shut down dating rumours about Jungkook. Earlier this week, a YouTuber claimed that Jungkook was dating Yumi's Cells star Lee Yoo Bi. In a video, the YouTuber claimed that Lee Yoo Bi is a fan of Jungkook and has been engaging in ‘lovestagram’ by sharing purple hearts on her Instagram account, a colour mostly associated with BTS. He video also pointed out that Jungkook's older brother and Lee Yoo Bi’s younger sister follow each other on the platform. However, Big Hit clarified that the claims are false. Lee Yoo Bi's agency Y-Bloom Entertainment also issued a statement to shut down claims. “That is a groundless [rumour]. Lee Yoo Bi and Jungkook’s dating news make no sense. They have never met, and they do not know each other. Among the BTS members, Lee Yoo Bi knew Suga, but that was a long time ago. We do not even know if they are in touch right now,” the statement read. A few weeks ago, even V was subjected to dating rumours. However the agency clarified that he is not seeing anyone. BTS members are currently on a break from work. RM, Jin and Suga are recovering from Covid-19 whereas J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are busy with their personal life.

89,"This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here is a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we have entered an off-season. We are going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It is not like we are disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore."" Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time."" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo.

174,"BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood. She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Two of the four opted out leaving Lenka and Brazil’s Gabriela Dalcin as the final contestants. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm. I too wanted to pursue dancing but could not fulfil the dream as my father did not approve of it. I do not know if my daughter would become the first K-pop idol from India, but I am happy that she is living her dream.” In a statement, DR Music said Lenka and Dalcin were undergoing basic practice and Korean language education. “They will go through...six months of training. It is the final audition. We have prepared to prove through the training process that they themselves are eligible to debut as K-pop artists. Therefore, we will evaluate whether they have the basic skills to perform as a K-pop artist, such as their personality and qualities...” Sonali said her cousin’s schedule is hectic. By the time she returns to her room, she is completely exhausted. “We have formed a family WhatsApp group in which she sometimes chats. But the conversations are very brief.”","BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood.

The video started with BTS' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, ""You have to straighten your arms."" He replied, ""I cannot go any higher because of the jacket. Here is the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him)."" As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, ""Now we only have one last shooting left.""

187,"BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - also known as the Bangtan Boys have been ruling the hearts since 2013, their debut showcase. And those who got to know about the Bangtannies now and are yet to explore their initial days are in for a treat. BTS members have been helluva goofy ever since they started training. And today, we are here with a throwback video of BTS members from the Dark &amp; Wild era. Once, the Bangtan Boys dropped a video on Bangtan TV wherein they turned a corridor into their ramp and flaunted their OTT ramp walk A year after their debut, the BTS members - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook - switched on their crazy side and decided to pretend to walk the ramp. It was late in the night, and the boys were in for some mischief and some fun it seems. They turned a corridor of their room into a ramp and pretended to be models and showcased their 'walks'. Of course, each of them went OTT and it is only going to leave the ARMY, laughing out loud The Bangtan Bomb video begins with Suga aka Min Yoongi. He oozes swag in his walk but it is certainly OTT. The posture he strikes before walking back will make you think whether he really is the calm and cool Yoongi. Up next is Jimin aka Park Jimin. He is like a bratty kid left loose in the park who tries to be a bully but backs off because, Jimin's kiddo, after all After Jimin, it is Jungkook aka the Golden Maknae's turn. It seems someone pushed Jungkook on the ramp forcefully. And now, he has to make it look cool. Jungkook looked like the kid who would brag but it is all just false pretence..Towards the end, JK strikes the spiderman-style pose and it is hilarious. Next, we have is J-Hope aka Jung Hoseok. He is got the style in his walk but later goofs it up with his real personality. J-Hope is the funniest in this one. The fourth member to walk the corridor ramp is V aka Kim Taehyung. And you all would know how much Taetae loves being extra! His dance before walking back would make you think if he is possessed or something. However, V ends it pretty smoothly It is RM's turn to walk the ramp. But instead of walking, he is just jumping around like an overexcited kid in the whole lot who later gets conscious and calms the hell down. Next comes the conjuring X star Jin, walking with the up in the bow pose, in the scariest manner. He falls down and but gets up only to walk in the most threatening manner as though challenging people to laugh. Lastly, they all walk the ramp, we mean, the corridor together. Taehyung, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook are still being extra while Jin turns into a cool kid. Suga seems to be trying to kick off the pain of his joints while RM's still conscious of his ramp walk. Watch the goofy and funny throwback BTS video here: It is been nine years since BTS' debut. And though they have considerably matured and evolved as people, they still are childish somewhere. Run BTS has been the proof of the same. ARMY, you would be glad to have Run BTS back, no?","And those who got to know about the Bangtannies now and are yet to explore their initial days are in for a treat.

198,"Under South Korean law, all able-bodied men are required to perform 18-21 months of military service. But the law provides special exemptions for athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers who have won top prizes in certain competitions that enhance national prestige. Recently, news agency AP, reported that commissioner of the Military Manpower Administration Lee Ki Sik told lawmakers on Friday that it is “desirable” for BTS members to fulfil their military duties to ensure fairness in the country’s military service. Earlier this week, Defence Minister Lee Jong-sup made almost identical comments about BTS at a parliamentary committee meeting, and Culture Minister Park Bo Gyoon said his ministry would soon finalize its position on the issue. Several amendments of the conscription law that would pave the way for BTS members to be exempted have been introduced in the National Assembly, but have not been voted on with lawmakers sharply divided on the matter. Without a revision of the law, the government can take steps to grant special exemptions. But past exemptions for people who performed well in non-designated competitions triggered a serious debate about the fairness of the system. Since the draft forces young men to suspend their professional careers or studies, the dodging of military duties or creation of exemptions is a highly sensitive issue. The public too remains sharply divided over whether BTS should be given exemptions. In a recent survey, about 61% of respondents supported exemptions for entertainers such as BTS, while in another, about 54% said BTS members should serve in the military. In August, Lee Jong-sup had said if BTS members join the military, they would likely be allowed to continue practising and to join other non-serving BTS members in overseas group tours. People who are exempted from the draft are released from the military after three weeks of basic training. They are also required to perform 544 hours of volunteer work and continue serving in their professional fields for 34 months.","But the law provides special exemptions for athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers who have won top prizes in certain competitions that enhance national prestige.

Speaking on fans visiting a museum after he has been there and posted pictures, RM called it 'really great that people could love one’s taste and be there'. He added that if 300 people see the same artwork, 'that is 300 different feelings'. Speaking on Intersections Season 2 podcast, RM said, “This is my first time actually saying this but seriously, I am planning to make a small space of my own private collection and then just make a cafe on the first floor and set up my collections on the second floor and third floor. People could always see the collections when they just want to see them. Because when people come to Korea, and it happens for the Koreans too, we cannot see the great Korean artists because there are not many museums right now. There are not many galleries right now. I just want to make my own some time."" RM also spoke about being a part of BTS and their sacrifices, ""Being a team member it does mean that we have to sacrifice our own soul or own personality, we have to cut it out because there are seven personalities and we were 19 or 18 when we started as a team but now we are almost 30. We became men and adults so we have different characters or maybe different future visions. But BTS is still really important for me, it is the biggest part of me. But keeping this intensity as a team made me easy to forget who I was &amp; why I started this thing. I just want to remind and reminisce myself as to why I started this, what can I do with my own thing. So for my 30s, I just want to figure out the way to exist like half for BTS member and leader RM and maybe just Namjoon Kim as himself."" RM spoke about himself and BTS days after the group, comprising him, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook released their anthology album Proof. The new album consists of several new and old songs. Recently, Proof scored the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart, thus making BTS win their sixth chart-topper.","He added that if 300 people see the same artwork, 'that is 300 different feelings'. Because when people come to Korea, and it happens for the Koreans too, we cannot see the great Korean artists because there are not many museums right now. We became men and adults so we have different characters or maybe different future visions. But keeping this intensity as a team made me easy to forget who I was &amp; why I started this thing. Recently, Proof scored the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart, thus making BTS win their sixth chart-topper. ","The BTS leader also spoke about his Instagram page which feels is 'kind of a curation' of art pieces. Speaking on fans visiting a museum after he has been there and posted pictures, RM called it 'really great that people could love one’s taste and be there'. Speaking on Intersections Season 2 podcast, RM said, “This is my first time actually saying this but seriously, I am planning to make a small space of my own private collection and then just make a cafe on the first floor and set up my collections on the second floor and third floor. People could always see the collections when they just want to see them. There are not many galleries right now. I just want to make my own some time. "" RM also spoke about being a part of BTS and their sacrifices, ""Being a team member it does mean that we have to sacrifice our own soul or own personality, we have to cut it out because there are seven personalities and we were 19 or 18 when we started as a team but now we are almost 30. But BTS is still really important for me, it is the biggest part of me. I just want to remind and reminisce myself as to why I started this, what can I do with my own thing.

202,"Run BTS' new episode featuring RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook is out and it is such an emotional moment for all the ARMYs. It is been 10 months since the last Run BTS episode dropped on Weverse. The new Run BTS episode is called Telepathy. And it is so much fun to see the boys get together and play the game again, just like the good old days. Along with the Run BTS episode, back were Bangtan Boys aka RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Kim Taehyung and Jungkook's goofy personalities. Let us check out the most heartwarming moment of Run BTS' latest episode In the latest episode of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtannies playing the Telepathy game. In the first game, they had to guess letters each based on questions. The telepathy of the Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook - kind of failed for various reasons. TO BE HONEST, we have to give it to the Run BTS producers/ directors who increased the difficulty level of Run BTS with such a game. The second was the game of guessing the gestures and it had to be Telepathically matched with the other members. Suga, Hobi and RM goofed up a couple of times. It was fun to see their expressive side back again. In this segment the Bangtan Boys worked hard on their acting skills, Jin and Taetae were quite natural So, the most heartwarming moment of the telepathy between four of the Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Jimin and Taehyung. It so happened that the septet were made to wear masks. They were taken to the lobby and were made to sit in different cars and were handed out clues each. They were given clues in terms of words and were asked to guess the destination and reach there. The clues for the first round were 'Real Fun'. Jimin, Taehyung, Jin and RM felt their old dorm was the place they had the most fun. Suga went to the Han River whereas J-Hope reached Jamsil Stadium where they had practised the most. Jungkook, on the other hand, had at first thought about the dorm too. But he later switched the destination to the far away place of Lotte World. The reunion of Jin, Taehyung, Jimin and RM through telepathy was indeed a heartwarming moment At the end of the Run BTS episode, we saw RM, Jimin and Taehyung discussing having thoughts of Lotte World too but had opted out due to the distance. Now, in the next episode of Run BTS, we will see three more rounds of destination telepathy being played. The clues for the second round are Salty or Mad. What could be the destination, ARMY, any guesses?","It is been 10 months since the last Run BTS episode dropped on Weverse.

236,"BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from the 2021 American Music Awards. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed the members practising Butter on stage. BTS' Jin and Suga got nostalgic and recalled performing their track DNA at the awards four years ago. The members were then seen discussing their parts, coordinating steps for the show and giving feedback. After Butter, they practised with Coldplay for their collaborative track My Universe. As they got ready on the last day of their dress rehearsal, Jin said, ""(Chris) Martin seemed to be enjoying the performance more than we expected. So I think we will be able to have more fun as well. It is our first collaboration performance on-air, so we will bring out all the fun and excitement."" RM said, ""This feels so unfamiliar. It is strange seeing people entering (the venue). There is a lot to memorise too. So I think we will not know until it actually begins. I know it will turn out fine though. I think we will have to get used to it quick."" Suga added: “It is our first time being a nominee for Artist of the Year (in the US), so we are very excited. I am really nervous. I am really sleepy but we are going to go rehearse Butter for the AMAs.” On the day of the award ceremony, as the members got ready, V was seen practising his speech in front of the camera. The members then got into their cars as they drove towards the venue. While J-Hope and V were seen together in one car, RM and Jimin travelled in another vehicle. Jin, Suga and Jungkook went together to the awards ceremony. In the car, as V kept repeating his lines, J-Hope started laughing. He then told V, ""We prepared so much, but once we go in, we will not be able to do much of what we prepared. I once did not say anything I prepared."" V added that it happened to him too. ""When I prepared a lot of things to say, I was so ready, 'I am going to pour out all the English I know today'. But I was basically silent. I will try to succeed this time. I only memorised the main points. So I think it will be okay."" As J-Hope and V enjoyed some fun moments, RM and Jimin were tense. The BTS leader said, ""Let us try to enjoy the awkwardness. You can be at the top if you can enjoy even this feeling."" Jimin joked, ""We are not celebrities, RM"" making the latter laugh. He continued, ""We are just Kim Najoon and Park Jimin. We are far from celebrities. About 420 km far?"" RM said, ""That is not how the world goes. We do not fix that kind of title."" Of all the members, Suga, Jin and Jungkook were the most relaxed. As he sat at the back of the car, Jungkook said, ""If they ask about New Years Resolution I can reply immediately."" Jin then quizzed him about his outfit to which he replied immediately. On reaching the venue, the BTS members changed outfits and discussed their performance of My Universe. After their My Universe performance ended, Jungkook said, ""I am so tired because I did not get much sleep last night. But I will focus hard and get through it. I will make sure I do not regret anything about today's performance."" At the AMAs, BTS won the Artist of the Year, favourite Pop Duo/Group and favourite Pop Song. Returning to their dressing room after their speech, an upset V said, ""I just kept on... seriously. Suddenly Namjon says 'You finish it off'. What about me?"" RM added, ""After I was done, 10 seconds later they were already signalling us to finish."" As he could not complete his speech on stage, V said, ""I am going to give my speech here."" He then gave his speech. Jungkook, who was teased by the members for giving a long speech, laughed and said, ""Fans are going to tease me a ton. ARMY is going to make fun again, what do I do? I wanted to look cool. Getting dragged off at the end."" RM consoled him saying, ""Just accept it and go home."" Jimin opined that giving a speech was more nerve-wracking than performing onstage: ""I think I am going to die. My heart feels like it is going to burst.""

247,"BTS members have spoken about a host of topics concerning them in the past year and also this new year. In an interview, the group members spoke about an ability they would want to acquire this year, a question that provokes them, an alternate profession, among other questions. In a video shared by Vogue Korea on YouTube, Jimin was asked about the words that impressed him the most in 2021. Replying to this, he said, “I remember the words, 'It is how it is'. Since the pandemic continues, lots of people are suffering and each person has different hardships and situations. I also went through some difficult times. I wanted to perform and met our fans too. So there was a time when I felt isolated. As time passed, I began to empathize with and felt the pain of the words, 'It is how it is'.” In the special edition interview, Jungkook was asked about the words that he wants to hear the most in 2022. He responded, ""Since there is no one who does not like compliments. I guess 'cool' would be the best. 'Cool' could be interpreted in various ways. It could mean the personality's cool or the performance on the stage is cool or the voice is cool. It can explain a lot of things, so I like the words, 'So cool'. So in 2022, I hope to hear such a word."" BTS' V was asked if he could obtain a new ability this year, what would he choose. He replied, “Besides music and dance, I want to get the ability to play the instruments well. When it comes to instruments, one has to invest lots of time into the songs they want to play and in the end, they can feel a huge sense of accomplishment. But, I do not know how to play instruments. I used to play the saxophone often back then, but I found out that it was too hard to play all the songs I love with just saxophone. So, whether it is trumpet, clarinet or violin, I would like to play all the songs I like, so I assume I would choose instruments.” Next, J-Hope was asked what is the thing he has always been better at than others. He said, ""When I meet people, I think I am good at absorbing them. Whoever I meet, I tend to try to go along with them, and I kind of absorb things like a sponge. That would be what I would call 'a thing I am better at than others'."" Jin was asked what profession would he want to choose, if not his current one. He answered, ""If I were to do something else as a profession, even though I do not sell stuff, I like to recommend things I got to friends around me. I have not recommended anything to my members, but I think I would like to work as a person who persuades that 'This is way better', so buy this one instead. A job of persuading that a certain product is better than others."" Suga was asked that if he were asked a question that provokes him the most, what would it be. ""A question that provokes me? 'What can you accomplish if you are so lazy like that? What would you do with such laziness?' I think this kind of question quite provokes me. I do tend to try hard to live diligently and busily, but I am still not satisfied, so I split my time even more. I hope to become a more diligent person, so those questions would provoke me."" Lastly, BTS leader RM was asked if he was mentioned in the textbook 50 years later, what sentence he would like there. He said, ""If I am to be included just 'There was this kind of person among K-pop idols'. I hope to be written as one of those 'examples'. A very unique person who loved music, worked hard and challenged on things. Just like that, I guess? If I were to be in the textbook, I think I should be an outliner."" He concluded by saying, ""We are already in the textbook, so it is fine."" Last year, BTS members had travelled to the US for four Los Angeles in-person concerts. They returned to South Korea in December. After that, BTS announced that they will be taking an 'extended period of rest', their first since 2019.","BTS members have spoken about a host of topics concerning them in the past year and also this new year.

And we came across a throwback post when Jin dressed up as Jimin. While it might be taken for Seokjin just messing things up for a joke but reports state that it was a very grave situation indeed Sadly, the BTS group has a lot of saesang fans out there. These fans often dish out threats about life to the Bangtan Boys. There are some nasty trolls as well who often dole out threats online without bothering about the consequences or the effects of those threats. It could be by solo saesang fans. And that is what happened years ago A saesang fan shared the story of why Kim Seokjin aka Jin and Park Jimin aka Jimin dressed alike at a soundcheck of a BTS concert. It so happened that one of the ARMYs who was present revealed that Jin had copied Jimin's look from head to toe. It was because of the threats that Jimin received. Koreaboo also reported that other media reports claimed that the person who gave death threats also posted pictures of the seat ticket from the concert online, to show that they were attending the concert As per reports, Jimin was quizzed about the incident at a press conference. Jimin went about his performance like usual and did not show his fears or inner turmoil during the performance. ARMYs were heartbroken with the whole thing.

Again, we are really sorry. ” Apart from this, the ad campaign had also grabbed ARMY’s attention as Jungkook debuted with his most unusual hairstyle—a mullet.

RM had said while he enjoyed being in BTS, the group members now feel ""exhausted"" and he does not ""know what kind of group we were any more"". Jimin admitted that the group has been going through a ""rough patch"" as it is trying to ""find our identity, and that is an exhausting and long process"". Now speaking to Reuters, Sang-hyun said that BTS took the break as the 'main reason' of 'waiting for parliament to decide has been hugely stressful' for them. ""The members cited exhaustion and the need for rest as the main reason but the real reason was Jin's military service,"" said Sang-hyun. He added that BTS raised the country's profile worldwide through ""soft power"" and it should be taken into account when considering their military service. ""BTS has done a job that would take more than 1,000 diplomats to do,"" said the lawmaker. South Korea's military service requires all able-bodied men aged between 18 and 28 to serve for about two years. Over the years, particular categories of men have won exemptions--either allowed to put off service for a certain time or allowed to do shorter service--including men who win a medal at the Olympics or Asian Games and classical musicians and dancers who win a top prize at certain competitions. Under a 2019 revision of the law in the country, globally recognised K-pop stars were allowed to put off their service until the age of 30. BTS management company, BigHit Music, has maintained that the group members are keen to do their duty. In April, BigHit official Lee Jin-hyung told a news conference in Las Vegas that some band members were having a ""hard time"" because of ""uncertainties"" over the parliament debate.

In 2010, at the age of 13, he passed a local audition in Australia for the K-pop label JYP Entertainment. Despite his young age, he moved to Korea to train at JYPE. Today's heartwarming letter in our Dear Oppa series has been penned by Shruti from India to Stray Kids’ Bangchan. Read her letter below.Dear Bang Chan,I.still vividly remember the first video that made me a fan of yours. Even though it is the 21st century, talking about periods is not something what many men do, leave alone a male kpop idol. But YOU did. Fearlessly! Not caring about how controversial it might turn out to be. Little did I know that one video would change my life for the better.

527,"One of the best things about today's generation is that they are vocal about mental health, want to learn about it, and want to spread awareness about it.Now, this is a super important and sensitive subject considering how severe the impacts of ill mental health can be, especially if you are working in the entertainment industry and have to fit certain criteria every time you are in front of the camera . .With their polished makeup, constant media attention, glitzy outfits, extreme diets, well-curated social media feeds, pressure to perform, and millions of adoring fans - it becomes difficult to see our favored K-pop celebs as one of us, regular humans.More often than not, we viewers idolize our on-screen K-pop stars and look up to them.And the topics of mental health, personal struggles, and illnesses are not something that is often discussed in the K-pop industry . .So, their opening up about their mental health struggles is equally brave and an eye-opener for all their followers.Not only do our favorite K-pop idols reveal the harsh reality of being in front of the camera 24*7, but they also tell the world that no one battling depression, anxiety, or any other form of mental illness is alone! We are there to support you, we believe in you, and most importantly, we care about you - there is no shame in seeking help or talking about your mental health struggles.On the contrary, our K-pop

offering condolence to his fans worldwide who feel alone in their mental battles .The BTS member opened up about his mental struggles back in 2016 when he released Agust D, his first mixtape.In that mixtape, he built an alter-ego who resisted all societal expectations but had a vulnerability that allowed him to rift the topic of mental health .In Agust D, SUGA raps,. .""On the other side of the famous idol rapper.Stands my weak self, it is a bit dangerous.Depression, OCD.They keep coming back again from time to time "". .Once again, in May 2021, in an interview with Rolling Stone, SUGA explained his mental health as cold weather wherein negative emotions come and go.He added that people must be encouraged to share their mental health struggles, rather than silently suffering and keeping it to themselves . .This BTS member has often used music and songs like The Last to look introspectively and address the depression and anxiety that he faces .He has also openly spoken about mental health disorders during many interviews.In one such interview, Suga stated, ""loneliness and anxiety stay forever.How you choose to make peace with them needs a lifetime of contemplation "".

health issues . .Kang Daniel.Kang Daniel, the former member of Want To One, has always been honest about his battles with mental illness.Not only has he been vocal about it, but he even based an entire album, Yellow, around this subject.This album included songs like Paranoia and Antidote and was released in April 2021.The songs were a reference to the three-month-long break that he took in November 2019 to focus on his mental well-being after dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic disorders.Fortunately, this much-needed break seemed to help him with how he felt about himself and the industry (in general), and he definitely returned feeling much stronger and better!. .In an interview with NME, Kang Daniel stated,.""I do not think I have changed, but I feel like there has been a change.I still read bad comments, but because I was able to overcome them once, I can just deal with them now.There is a certain way to do that, and I trust myself and the people around me to help me.There are good days and bad days, but there is always a reason to live.There are good things about life, and that is what I look for now "". .Jeongyeon (Twice).JYP Entertainment announced in August

raising awareness about mental health illness and toxic positivity . .S Coups (SEVENTEEN).Undoubtedly, K-pop idols are stressed owing to the high expectations of their viewers and fans.However, nobody

his anxiety did not allow him to participate in the world tour of Ode To You . .He, too, did not shy away from speaking about it.In a behind-the-scenes series, titled Hit The Road, S Coups spoke about his emotions, saying that he tried to ride out but ultimately decided to take a break.He further stated that although performing brought him happiness, he did not want things to change due to his mental health issues . .Lee Ji-Eun, a-k-a IU.IU is undoubtedly one of the cutest and most well-known female K-pop idols.She was only a teenager when she debuted as a K-pop soloist (without having other people or members to lean on as in bands).However, not only did she eventually find her footing in the Korean industry, she went on to become one of the most immensely successful artists . .What fans may not is that this popular Palette singer suffered from Bulimia Nervosa, a potentially life-threatening and harmful eating disorder, in the earlier days of her career.This also unconsciously manifested as anxiety about her weight.Moreover, she even had to follow an extreme diet (dubbed the IU diet) to lose weight (as per Korean beauty standards) for an acting project . .Although despite everything, she did not back down and spoke about her experiences in 2014 at SBS' Healing Camp.She stated that she sought help for her anxiety issue and Bulimia.Furthermore, IU also highlighted the

Awards, she urged her fellow artists to prioritize themselves and openly and honestly express their emotions - before comforting their fans (as the old adage goes, ""help yourselves so that you can help others ""). .Jonghyun (SHINee).Though it seems almost impossible to bring up his name without referring to his death (he took his own life after struggling with depression) in 2017, SHINee's vocalist Kim Jonghyun was one of the very first K-pop idols and the loudest voices to speak up about mental health . .Jonghyun used his fame and Korean platform to she would light on significant issues and taboos surrounding mental health.He literally had done it all - from openly handling queries about mental health on Blue Night, his radio show, to supporting a trans fan who bravely opened up about their struggles . .Moreover, this K-pop idol even spoke up about his own depression in the songs, Let Me Out (which he himself penned down) and A Gloomy Clock by IU (featuring Jonghyun) . .Kim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA.In 2016, HyunA was hospitalized and diagnosed with panic disorders and depression.It took a year for Kim, the former 4Minute band member, to come to terms with her mental

struggles during her career, Hani expressed her wish to work specifically with K-Pop idols as she knows how tough their lives can be . .Kwon Mina (AOA).In 2020, there were rumors that the former AOA member Kwon Mina was bullied by Jimin, their band’s leader, while other members stayed silent .In July 2021, one year after these allegations surfaced, it was reported that she had attempted to take her own life . .After regaining consciousness, Mina announced her plans to take serious legal action against the bullying rumors spread by netizens.In September 2021, Dispatch, the Korean news outlet, released messages between the AOA band members, including Jimin and Kwon, in which they had discussed the bullying issue . .Taeyeon (Girls’ Generation).Following the death of her close friends Jonghyun and Sulli, several of her fans were concerned about her mental health condition.Back in June 2019, during an Instagram question-and-answer session, Taeyeon got candid when someone rudely asked her if she had bipolar disorder and ended it with a ""tsk tsk "". .She revealed that she was suffering from depression and was taking medicine and working hard to get better.She also stated that she seems most vulnerable and at her worst after she is done with her touring and concerts and is left feeling alone without being surrounded by many people.Further, she commented, ""whether it is

critical.However, since then she has not spoken much about her mental health condition . .Jay B (Got7).In March 2021, in an interview with ARENA Magazine, the former Got7 member Jay B announced that

from a teacher, which proved to be incredibly beneficial for him . .He took to Twitter to express himself and stated,.""There was a point where I really had a hard time, but I met a good teacher.I draw, it is called art therapy, it is healing your mind through drawing, and I met a teacher who helps people who have hard times, they became a great help in my life.What is hard is that I am an adult encountering society and looking for a way to handle it, but since I am young and inexperienced.It is as if I put my hand here, and it hurts like hell, but (there is no) way.So when I was like that, the teacher guided me well, and I became the person that I am today with the thoughts I have right now "". .Wendy (Red Velvet).In an episode of Mysterious Record Shop, Red Velvet's Wendy spoke up about obtaining psychological help for the mental difficulties that she had been facing . .She stated,.""When we are promoting, we do not have a break.I do not think I should express my hardships.I

criticism because of her sex video scandal with Choi Jong-bum.Goo Hara's former boyfriend, Choi, was a hairdresser and had assaulted her, threatening to release a sex video of the two.Though Choi was

request an autopsy.It was assumed that he took his own life after struggling with mental health issues . .Yeonwoo (Momoland).Yeonwoo had previously taken a break from the promotions of the girl group

She spoke about her mental health struggles during a talk show, Healing Camp, on SBS. She even blatantly called out to people who forgot that she was merely a child. Not only has he been vocal about it, but he even based an entire album, Yellow, around this subject. ""I do not think I have changed, but I feel like there has been a change. I still read bad comments, but because I was able to overcome them once, I can just deal with them now. There is a certain way to do that, and I trust myself and the people around me to help me. There are good days and bad days, but there is always a reason to live. There are good things about life, and that is what I look for now "". Jae, Day6's member, had a near-death experience in 2020 when he suffered a panic attack while driving. He thought he could live through his anxiety and sweep things under the rug. That was until things reached a critical point. Since then, Jae has taken actions, such as medication, to help with his mental condition. Undoubtedly, K-pop idols are stressed owing to the high expectations of their viewers and fans. However, nobody compares when it comes to the leaders of the respective bands and groups. The leader of the band, SEVENTEEN, S Coups is one such example. He had to take a pause from band activities when the symptoms of his anxiety did not allow him to participate in the world tour of Ode To You. He, too, did not shy away from speaking about it. However, not only did she eventually find her footing in the Korean industry, she went on to become one of the most immensely successful artists. This also unconsciously manifested as anxiety about her weight. She stated that she sought help for her anxiety issue and Bulimia. In 2016, HyunA was hospitalized and diagnosed with panic disorders and depression. It took a year for Kim, the former 4Minute band member, to come to terms with her mental condition. I am going to be courageous and honest like I am now ”. It has been quite a while since Hani has been speaking up about her interest in becoming a psychotherapist post her career as a K-pop idol. In 2020, there were rumors that the former AOA member Kwon Mina was bullied by Jimin, their band’s leader, while other members stayed silent. In July 2021, one year after these allegations surfaced, it was reported that she had attempted to take her own life. Following the death of her close friends Jonghyun and Sulli, several of her fans were concerned about her mental health condition. Her response was hugely appreciated and appropriately critical. However, since then she has not spoken much about her mental health condition. Jay B (Got7). He stated, ""I thought I was just mentally weaker than other people "". In May 2021, in an interview with Allure, he once again spoke candidly about his anxiety and depression. Thankfully, Jay B started taking therapy and medication after his diagnosis. He also acknowledged the fact that there is no shame in prioritizing yourself and taking care of your mental health. NCT's Renjun is one of the most outspoken members, especially when it comes to talking about mental health illnesses and disorders. He took to Twitter to express himself and stated,. It is as if I put my hand here, and it hurts like hell, but (there is no) way. So when I was like that, the teacher guided me well, and I became the person that I am today with the thoughts I have right now "". ""When we are promoting, we do not have a break. I did not know it myself because I was hiding all these things ”. Furthermore, Wendy said,. ""I was more apprehensive about others and did not focus and prioritize my own needs. However, I finally plucked the courage to go for counseling with a psychologist because I was biting my tail and biting my tail”. Han (Stray Kids). Stray Kids' member Han is not the only band member to have discussed having trouble with his mental health. He has also spoken about having social anxiety in certain situations. Moreover, he also used to breaks during some of the promotional events of the band owing to his anxiety. Thankfully, his fans quickly sent their support and showered him with their love at the time. Sully was outspoken by nature with overtly sexual tones and was often caught in disfavor amongst many Koreans. She was even cyberbullied for her persona, with many followers leaving numerous negative comments on her social media. She had struggled with social phobia, panic disorder, and depression before she died on October 2019. Kara's Goo Hara and Sulli were very close friends, and only a month after her death, news broke about Goo’s death. Goo Hara's former boyfriend, Choi, was a hairdresser and had assaulted her, threatening to release a sex video of the two. Leeteuk (Super Junior). Leeteuk, a member of the K-pop band Super Junior, is well-known for his outspoken persona and variety of capabilities. Leeteuk has often spoken that he is battling depression. Not only did he reveal his struggle with mental illness, he even expressed his painful family background. Heechul was a close friend of Jonghyun and Sulli. After the death of Kara's Goo Hara, he privatized his Instagram account to deal with the loss. He made his debut in 2017 with Temperature of Love, a Korean TV drama. He was starring in Love with Flaws at the time of his death. A slightly bizarre fact is that neither did he leave a will or a message nor did his family request an autopsy. It was assumed that he took his own life after struggling with mental health issues. Ultimately, she started to feel better, left her girl group, and started her solo career as a K-pop actress. Behind the curtains, our beloved K-pop idols often go through a lot of pressure in the course of their careers. And at times, navigating life constantly dealing with mental health issues can become overwhelming and tough. Hopefully, you will support your favorite K-pop artists and also take their advice to reach out for help if and when you need it. If you need support or know someone who is struggling, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist or speak to someone about it. There are multiple helplines available for the same. Once again, please remember that you are not alone!. ","One of the best things about today's generation is that they are vocal about mental health, want to learn about it, and want to spread awareness about it. Now, this is a super important and sensitive subject considering how severe the impacts of ill mental health can be, especially if you are working in the entertainment industry and have to fit certain criteria every time you are in front of the camera. With their polished makeup, constant media attention, glitzy outfits, extreme diets, well-curated social media feeds, pressure to perform, and millions of adoring fans - it becomes difficult to see our favored K-pop celebs as one of us, regular humans. And the topics of mental health, personal struggles, and illnesses are not something that is often discussed in the K-pop industry. Not only do our favorite K-pop idols reveal the harsh reality of being in front of the camera 24*7, but they also tell the world that no one battling depression, anxiety, or any other form of mental illness is alone! We are there to support you, we believe in you, and most importantly, we care about you - there is no shame in seeking help or talking about your mental health struggles. On the contrary, our K-pop idols encourage us to open up about our mental health battles just like they do - be it in the form of their songs or in their candid interviews. So, today we will talk about some of your beloved K-pop idols who spoke about their mental health, the impact, and how they dealt with it. (Trigger Warning - This article contains references to mental illness, mental health struggles, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and suicide ). SUGA (BTS). He has frequently spoken up about his battles with depression, social anxiety, and OCD while offering condolence to his fans worldwide who feel alone in their mental battles. In that mixtape, he built an alter-ego who resisted all societal expectations but had a vulnerability that allowed him to rift the topic of mental health. Depression, OCD. They keep coming back again from time to time "". Once again, in May 2021, in an interview with Rolling Stone, SUGA explained his mental health as cold weather wherein negative emotions come and go. He added that people must be encouraged to share their mental health struggles, rather than silently suffering and keeping it to themselves. This BTS member has often used music and songs like The Last to look introspectively and address the depression and anxiety that he faces. RM (BTS). BTS members have never shied away from openly speaking about rough and sensitive issues that the youths of today face. So, when RM fans questioned him about his well-being - when he hosted a live broadcast to celebrate his 27th birthday on 12 September - he replied, ""every day is a fight to not lose to depression and not giving up "". We, as his fans and followers, are pleased to see that he spoke about his mental well-being and is making time for activities, like cleaning his room, exercising, and watering plants, that support his physical as well as mental health. She was merely 15 years old when she was thrust into fame. While being an actor and K-pop idol got her stardom, she was beyond stressed and battled depression during the initial years of her career. The former member of Miss A appears to be doing considerably better and also released an English number, Cape, which is the perspective of being someone is aid as they steer through their mental health issues. Kang Daniel. Kang Daniel, the former member of Want To One, has always been honest about his battles with mental illness. This album included songs like Paranoia and Antidote and was released in April 2021. The songs were a reference to the three-month-long break that he took in November 2019 to focus on his mental well-being after dealing with anxiety, depression, and panic disorders. Fortunately, this much-needed break seemed to help him with how he felt about himself and the industry (in general), and he definitely returned feeling much stronger and better!. In an interview with NME, Kang Daniel stated,. Jeongyeon (Twice). JYP Entertainment announced in August 2021 that Twice's Jeongyeon would take her second break owing to psychological anxiety and panic disorder. The company further added that while she did perform at the 30th Seoul Music Awards (at the end of January) with her entire group, both parties have mutually decided to prioritize her mental health. Jeongyeon also took to Bubble, a messaging app, to assure her fans and followers that she would return feeling better and healthier. Jae (Day6). Plus, he is also actively raising awareness about mental health illness and toxic positivity. S Coups (SEVENTEEN). In a behind-the-scenes series, titled Hit The Road, S Coups spoke about his emotions, saying that he tried to ride out but ultimately decided to take a break. He further stated that although performing brought him happiness, he did not want things to change due to his mental health issues. Lee Ji-Eun, a-k-a IU. IU is undoubtedly one of the cutest and most well-known female K-pop idols. She was only a teenager when she debuted as a K-pop soloist (without having other people or members to lean on as in bands). What fans may not is that this popular Palette singer suffered from Bulimia Nervosa, a potentially life-threatening and harmful eating disorder, in the earlier days of her career. Moreover, she even had to follow an extreme diet (dubbed the IU diet) to lose weight (as per Korean beauty standards) for an acting project. Although despite everything, she did not back down and spoke about her experiences in 2014 at SBS' Healing Camp. Furthermore, IU also highlighted the fact of how much stress is faced by all the K-pop idols, emotionally referring to the loss of one of her dear friends as they took their own life. In 2018, during her speech at the Golden Disc Awards, she urged her fellow artists to prioritize themselves and openly and honestly express their emotions - before comforting their fans (as the old adage goes, ""help yourselves so that you can help others ""). Jonghyun (SHINee). Though it seems almost impossible to bring up his name without referring to his death (he took his own life after struggling with depression) in 2017, SHINee's vocalist Kim Jonghyun was one of the very first K-pop idols and the loudest voices to speak up about mental health. Jonghyun used his fame and Korean platform to she would light on significant issues and taboos surrounding mental health. He literally had done it all - from openly handling queries about mental health on Blue Night, his radio show, to supporting a trans fan who bravely opened up about their struggles. Moreover, this K-pop idol even spoke up about his own depression in the songs, Let Me Out (which he himself penned down) and A Gloomy Clock by IU (featuring Jonghyun). Kim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA. Kim Hyun-ah, a-k-a HyunA, revealed in a letter that she had actually wanted to keep her mental health illness a secret, but she could not hide it further. She even wrote, “I am bravely going to keep trying to be well, but I think people can not be perfect. I think it is not too late. I am going to love myself and take care of myself. Hani (EXID). Having dealt with her own mental health struggles during her career, Hani expressed her wish to work specifically with K-Pop idols as she knows how tough their lives can be. Kwon Mina (AOA). After regaining consciousness, Mina announced her plans to take serious legal action against the bullying rumors spread by netizens. In September 2021, Dispatch, the Korean news outlet, released messages between the AOA band members, including Jimin and Kwon, in which they had discussed the bullying issue. Taeyeon (Girls’ Generation). Back in June 2019, during an Instagram question-and-answer session, Taeyeon got candid when someone rudely asked her if she had bipolar disorder and ended it with a ""tsk tsk "". She revealed that she was suffering from depression and was taking medicine and working hard to get better. She also stated that she seems most vulnerable and at her worst after she is done with her touring and concerts and is left feeling alone without being surrounded by many people. Further, she commented, ""whether it is bipolar disorder or depression, do not just ""tsk tsk"" people and look at them negatively. They are all patients who are sick and in pain "". In March 2021, in an interview with ARENA Magazine, the former Got7 member Jay B announced that he had been diagnosed with clinical depression which actually came to him as a surprise. He further shared, ""for more than 3-4 years, I have felt extreme pressure and burden as an artist, but instead of taking medication, I often hid those feelings away ”. he even shared that he is getting better after getting the proper help. After his experience, he has frequently encouraged his fans and followers to confidently talk about these kinds of problems and to seek professional help, if needed, for their own mental well-being. Renjun (NCT). Although he has never been specific about what he is battling, Renjun has often talked about how he has had a hard time and learned art therapy from a teacher, which proved to be incredibly beneficial for him. ""There was a point where I really had a hard time, but I met a good teacher. I draw, it is called art therapy, it is healing your mind through drawing, and I met a teacher who helps people who have hard times, they became a great help in my life. What is hard is that I am an adult encountering society and looking for a way to handle it, but since I am young and inexperienced. Wendy (Red Velvet). In an episode of Mysterious Record Shop, Red Velvet's Wendy spoke up about obtaining psychological help for the mental difficulties that she had been facing. She stated,. I do not think I should express my hardships. In December 2019, JYP Entertainment had also announced that Han would be taking a break from some fan signs due to intermittent psychological anxiety. Also, he revealed that his anxiety disorder seems to be more stable nowadays. f(x) Sulli. Sulli was a highly popular former member of the South Korean pop girl group f(x). Goo Hara (Kara). Goo Hara, a former member of the girl group Kara, suffered grave bouts of cyberbullying and online criticism because of her sex video scandal with Choi Jong-bum. Though Choi was ultimately put into jail, things went much worse for Goo Hara as she was brutally trolled and harassed on social media. Goo Hara had released a musical single, and only a week later came the news of her shocking death, which took her fans by utmost surprise. He revealed how his father murdered his frail grandparents and took his own life, leaving him with a debt of five billion dollars ($5,835) that he had to work off. Kim Heechul (Super Junior). Heechul is yet another member of the K-pop group Super Junior who is vastly known for his outspoken and hilarious persona on South Korean variety shows, including Knowing Bros (2015 - present). However, behind all those laughs is a person struggling with depression. As per the reports, he also shut himself down for about three months when Hankyung, a former Super Junior member, left the group. Cha In-ha. Cha In-ha, aged 27, was a young newbie K-pop actor who passed in December 2019. As his death followed the deaths of two other K-pop idols - Goo Hara and Sulli - many fans and followers started raising apprehensions about copycat suicides. Yeonwoo (Momoland). Yeonwoo had previously taken a break from the promotions of the girl group Momoland. This gap even resulted in sparking rumors that she was leaving the group. However, the agency waved away all such rumors and claimed that Yeonwoo was getting treatment for her mental condition of panic disorder. Conclusion. Being a celebrity with global influence is never easy. So, rather than nonchalantly dusting off this rather sensitive issue, these K-pop idols openly spoke up about their mental health disorders and their impacts. Apart from these K-pop idols, even G-Dragon and MONSTA X's Joohooney have also been open about their mental health issues and struggles.

The jogger pants are out of stock but we guess as a BTS member SUGA has his privileges RM told him that SUGA wore L while he was XL. In his second comment, RM said he could have asked this size related information on group chat rather than on Instagram. Needless to say, fans began discussing how the boys use Instagram as.group chat nowadays. Many were shocked to know that SUGA buys clothing in size L. Others pointed out that he has broad shoulders unlike other members. RM has buffed up immensely so it is not surprising that he needs XL. After all, most fans know him as 'Little Kitten' and 'Smol Bean' . Fans also reminisced about the time RM said that SUGA and he wore same size underwear. After living together for 11 years, they are as familiar to each other as husband and wife. In fact, RM had once said that if he did not like his impulsive buys he could easily pass them to SUGA as they wear same size ARMY cannot get over this #NamGi interaction. RM's idea to put this on Kakao Talk is perhaps because he guessed what kind of conversation it would inspires in ARMYs. The septet is assumed to get back to work by end of January 2022.

Now, fans are coping up with this separation news in varied ways. Many have been very critical of the South Korean Government for not acknowledging the efforts of the boy band in promoting the nation's culture In the mean time, some Korean fans are worried that Jungkook being the adventurous man he is, might decide to join the Navy, marines or Airforce. The tenure there is longer. They have been writing small notes on social media for Jungkook to make him promise that he will only stick to the Army and be back. It looks like Jin, RM, JHope and SUGA are now only eligible for the ARMY and not combat missions. But K-ARMYs are worried about Jungkook who might want to challenge himself.

Now, fans are coping up with this separation news in varied ways. But K-ARMYs are worried about Jungkook who might want to challenge himself. It means people are buying purple rubber sandals too. In Korea, women wear white rubber sandals in the period when their partners are away for military enlistment. ","BTS is going to enlist in the Korean military with Jin being the first to head after releasing his solo song by end of October. It seems he has made up his mind to go at the earliest. It seems Jungkook will be the last one to go. He has been working on a solo album. Many have been very critical of the South Korean Government for not acknowledging the efforts of the boy band in promoting the nation's culture In the mean time, some Korean fans are worried that Jungkook being the adventurous man he is, might decide to join the Navy, marines or Airforce. The tenure there is longer. They have been writing small notes on social media for Jungkook to make him promise that he will only stick to the Army and be back. It looks like Jin, RM, JHope and SUGA are now only eligible for the ARMY and not combat missions. Take a look at the tweets This is not all.

He has said that the boys can perform at global concerts in their enlistment period. The minister made this comment on Monday in the middle of a debate on whether military service for K-Pop stars should be shortened to three weeks. As of now, the period is close to two years.

Jungkook also made fans feel mushy when he said he did like to recreate the epic kissing scene from the movie Love 911. This proves that he is quite a romantic at heart BTS member J-Hope has a passion for dance and keeping others happy. Jung Hoseok or Hobi is perceptive, hard-working and caring.

He told fans to keep their fourth finger empty (for the marriage ring), and coolly asked for the documents when someone proposed to him. SUGA is always flooded with marriage proposals and why not.

Apart from these, there have been no confirmed signed deals with any brands for the rest of the members. Here is what we can expect in the coming days. RM for Bottega Veneta. While it is possible that Kim Namjoon chose his outfits based on his own preferences rather than a fashion deal, fans are hoping that the smart styling becomes the right fit for him. To add to their beliefs they have found out that Matthieu Blazy, the creative director, and Dario Gargiulo, the chief marketing and digital business officer of Bottega Veneta started following the BTS member recently. V for Celine. It is more likely than not that the BTS member signs with the French luxury brand following his solo gig alongside BLACKPINK’s Lisa and Park Bo Gum last year which went viral for all the right reasons. V is known to harbour a special liking for the brand and can easily carry their confident fits with flair. Jungkook for Versace. The youngest from the group was spotted in a fabulous fit from the brand for his performance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony. They also have edgier options for when Jungkook wishes to do different and following the group’s meeting with Donatella Versace at the 64th GRAMMY Awards, it seems more than likely. Jin for Cartier. While the oldest member is currently serving in the military and will not sign anything until he is back, fans are rooting for Jin to land a deal with Cartier with whom they think he would be the best fit",0.8558228015899658,0.9766527313832847,0.9122541193188595
