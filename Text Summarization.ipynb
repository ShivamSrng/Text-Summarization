       "'BTS consists of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook&mdash;co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.\\n\\nBTS in the beginning:\\n\\nAfter launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group&#39;s second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking several sales records. They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single Mic Drop, as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).&nbsp;\\n\\nBTS&#39; achievements:&nbsp;\\n\\nBTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966&ndash;1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite. Their follow-up releases Savage Love, Life Goes On, Butter, and Permission to Dance made them the quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.\\n\\nBTS in 2022:\\n\\nAs of 2022, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history, having sold in excess of 30 million albums via the Circle Chart, and their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to hold sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&#39;s (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021.\\nALSO READ: Watch: BTS teases hilarious RUN BTS TV On-air show: V hosts, SUGA paints, Jungkook on drums and more\\n\\nStay updated with the latest Hallyu news on:&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;YouTube,&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;and&nbsp;Snapchat\\n\\nWhich BTS member did you get?

It\\'s much quieter than I expected and feels like a rural town. I like the familiar atmosphere.\" RM attended Art Basel and explained on camera the details of the art fair.

Showing the pattern of a ping pong table, RM said, \"The table looks like our (BTS) symbol.\" He also spoke about the art pieces as he viewed them. After that, RM took a tram to visit the Foundation Beyeler, a museum. He later took a walk through the city. On his third day, RM visited the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Vitra Design Museum and the gallery. As he walked around, RM showed a chair to his fans and said, \"I have breaking news for you guys. Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin made a chair and it\\'s displayed in the Vitra Design Museum. If you see this Chris, give me a call. You\\'re amazing.\" RM next visited Lucerne and hiked to Mount Rigi. Recalling his previous visit to Lucerne, RM added, \"I remember the day of crossing that bridge and buying souvenirs.\" He was also reminded of Bon Voyage, a reality show featuring BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Speaking to the camera, RM said, \"I rode the SSB train to Lucerne, rode a boat, rode the mountain train, walked down the track road, rode the cable cars, and now I\\'m on a boat planning to go ride the SSB again.\" RM\\'s travel in Switzerland ended with a visit to the Museum Tinguely. Next, RM flew to Paris to attend the Pinault Collection and to visit Musee d\\'Orsay. He then went to Centre Georges-Pompidou and Orsay Museum. RM\\'s vlog ended with him enjoying a Korean meal and then heading back to Seoul.'"

       "'2022 came to a celebratory end for BTS, especially member J-Hope, who was in New York, making another fabulous display of his skills  While away from the members, he seemed to have enjoyed it to the fullest with a solo performance at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve where he did a live stage of 3 songs, solo track &lsquo;= (Equal Sign)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Chicken Noodle Soup&rsquo; his collaboration track with Becky G, and BTS&rsquo; &lsquo;Butter&rsquo; (Holiday Remix)  He officially became only the second South Korean soloist to perform at the event, following PSY  This was also J-Hope&rsquo;s third time at Dick Clark&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Rockin&rsquo; Eve after group stages with BTS in 2017 and 2019 \\n\\nJ-Hope&rsquo;s live\\n\\nAfter returning from Times Square where he performed as the penultimate act alongside multiple other singers from around the world and spoke to Ryan Seacrest, the host of the show, J-Hope was back at his hotel room and turned on a live broadcast to speak with his fans  As they congratulated him on his sparkling performance, being the perfectionist that he is, J-Hope expressed his sadness about being unable to use his voice to the fullest and talked about the slipping incident due to the rainy weather during his rehearsal stage &nbsp;\\n\\nJ-Hope on other BTS members&rsquo; New Year wishes\\n\\nAs soon as it turned 12, and the New Year began in South Korea, BTS members Jungkook, Jimin, and V took to the fan community platform Weverse to share their wishes with the fans as well as discuss their plans for the coming year  Jungkook and V kept it brief, wishing for a successful and happy year ahead while Jimin wrote a big letter to his fans about the feelings he had seemingly bottled for a long time about his wishes to release new music soon for which he has been meeting up with composers \\n\\nThousands of miles away, member J-Hope was his cheeky self as he unleashed all his love for his fellow BTS members  He began commenting &lsquo;love you&rsquo; on their posts with cute words and received laughs from them in return \\n\\nJin&rsquo;s call to J-Hope\\n\\nOn being asked about BTS&rsquo; oldest member Jin who became the first from the group to enlist in the military on December 13, J-Hope recalled how he was called by the member with a different phone number and almost missed it  J-Hope said, &ldquo;Right before I was about to sleep on the 31st, I got a call from Jin and asked him how he was doing to which he said J-Hope, pick up your phone  I told him I did not know this number, how would I know it was his?&rdquo;\\n\\nThe &lsquo;Arson&rsquo; hitmaker spoke with a smile on his face about how he felt happy hearing Jin&rsquo;s voice  It comforted him and J-Hope mentioned how he remembered all those moments he spent with Jin  He assured the fans by saying that Jin seemed to be healthy and doing well in the military  So in place of Jin, he shared that he was well and asked the fans to not worry  The lovely duo, BTS&rsquo; Jin and J-Hope nicknamed 2seok have always&nbsp;lightened the fans&rsquo; hearts with this interaction \\nhttps://twitter com/nightstar1201/status/1609428759454822401Jimin X Taeyang\\n\\nBTS member Jimin and BIGBANG member Taeyang are a collaboration nobody would have expected  However, in December 2022, it was reported by industry officials that the two are working together on a release that will soon be revealed to the world  To this, Taeyang&rsquo;s then-agency, YG Entertainment, which he has since departed, replied by saying that they cannot confirm anything at the moment and asked fans to anticipate Taeyang&rsquo;s activities &nbsp;\\n\\nOn January 1, Taeyang who is currently a free agent, not having signed with anyone for his solo activities as he continues to be with YG Entertainment for any content related to BIGBANG, shared a rare update on his Instagram account  2 photos were shared with a caption of the hashtag #2023  In black and white, 2 people could be seen in the photos, their backs to the camera  While one could easily be spotted as Taeyang himself, the other one was not tagged &nbsp;\\n\\n                                                                                    \\n                                                                                Fans went into action and soon began investigating every detail of the photo  The other person seemed to be Jimin, as his hands, fluffy hair, and earrings seem to match the BTS member  Though no official announcement was made from either side, it seems that the singers have decided to give a green signal from their ends  Taeyang is rumoured to have been preparing for a January 2023 comeback so it seems as though we can expect the reports any time now  Once confirmed, this could very well be the biggest release of the year and one of the most hyped collaborations in K-pop history!\\n\\nMeanwhile, BIGBANG&rsquo;s G-Dragon also announced that he is working on an album and hopes to release it in 2023 \\n\\nStay updated with the latest Hallyu news on: Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat\\nALSO READ: BTS’ J-Hope, TXT wow at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve: 5 highlights from their stages'"

       "'After reaching his hotel in the city, RM revealed that his stay would be for four days and added that he would step out for dinner. As he sat at a roadside open-air restaurant, RM feasted on beer, burgers and fries. He said, \"I am starving right now. I am out to grab some food. It is much quieter than I expected and feels like a rural town. I like the familiar atmosphere.\" RM attended Art Basel and explained on camera the details of the art fair. He also gave a glimpse as he had noodles and beer which was followed by soup noodles and wrap. Showing the pattern of a ping pong table, RM said, \"The table looks like our (BTS) symbol.\" He also spoke about the art pieces as he viewed them. After that, RM took a tram to visit the Foundation Beyeler, a museum. He later took a walk through the city. On his third day, RM visited the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Vitra Design Museum and the gallery. As he walked around, RM showed a chair to his fans and said, \"I have breaking news for you guys. Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin made a chair and it is displayed in the Vitra Design Museum. If you see this Chris, give me a call. You are amazing.\" RM next visited Lucerne and hiked to Mount Rigi. Recalling his previous visit to Lucerne, RM added, \"I remember the day of crossing that bridge and buying souvenirs.\" He was also reminded of Bon Voyage, a reality show featuring BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Speaking to the camera, RM said, \"I rode the SSB train to Lucerne, rode a boat, rode the mountain train, walked down the track road, rode the cable cars, and now I am on a boat planning to go ride the SSB again.\" RM\\'s travel in Switzerland ended with a visit to the Museum Tinguely. Next, RM flew to Paris to attend the Pinault Collection and to visit Musee d\\'Orsay. He then went to Centre Georges-Pompidou and Orsay Museum. RM\\'s vlog ended with him enjoying a Korean meal and then heading back to Seoul.'"

       "'2022 came to a celebratory end for BTS, especially member J-Hope, who was in New York, making another fabulous display of his skills.While away from the members, he seemed to have enjoyed it to the fullest with a solo performance at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve where he did a live stage of 3 songs, solo track ‘= (Equal Sign)’, ‘Chicken Noodle Soup’ his collaboration track with Becky G, and BTS’ ‘Butter’ (Holiday Remix).He officially became only the second South Korean soloist to perform at the event, following PSY.This was also J-Hope’s third time at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve after group stages with BTS in 2017 and 2019 .J-Hope’s live.After returning from Times Square where he performed as the penultimate act alongside multiple other singers from around the world and spoke to Ryan Seacrest, the host of the show, J-Hope was back at his hotel room and turned on a live broadcast to speak with his fans.As they congratulated him on his sparkling performance, being the perfectionist that he is, J-Hope expressed his sadness about being unable to use his voice to the fullest and talked about the slipping incident due to the rainy weather during his rehearsal stage..J-Hope on other BTS members’ New Year wishes.As soon as it turned 12, and the New Year began in South Korea, BTS members Jungkook, Jimin, and V took to the fan community platform Weverse to share their wishes with the fans as well as discuss their plans for the coming year.Jungkook and V kept it brief, wishing for a successful and happy year ahead while Jimin wrote a big letter to his fans about the feelings he had seemingly bottled for a long time about his wishes to release new music soon for which he has been meeting up with composers .Thousands of miles away, member J-Hope was his cheeky self as he unleashed all his love for his fellow BTS members.He began commenting ‘love you’ on their posts with cute words and received laughs from them in return .Jin’s call to J-Hope.On being asked about BTS’ oldest member Jin who became the first from the group to enlist in the military on December 13, J-Hope recalled how he was called by the member with a different phone number and almost missed it.J-Hope said, “Right before I was about to sleep on the 31st, I got a call from Jin and asked him how he was doing to which he said J-Hope, pick up your phone.I told him I did not know this number, how would I know it was his?”.The ‘Arson’ hitmaker spoke with a smile on his face about how he felt happy hearing Jin’s voice.It comforted him and J-Hope mentioned how he remembered all those moments he spent with Jin.He assured the fans by saying that Jin seemed to be healthy and doing well in the military.So in place of Jin, he shared that he was well and asked the fans to not worry.The lovely duo, BTS’ Jin and J-Hope nicknamed 2seok have always lightened the fans’ hearts with this interaction .https://twitter com/nightstar1201/status/1609428759454822401Jimin X Taeyang.BTS member Jimin and BIGBANG member Taeyang are a collaboration nobody would have expected.However, in December 2022, it was reported by industry officials that the two are working together on a release that will soon be revealed to the world.To this, Taeyang’s then-agency, YG Entertainment, which he has since departed, replied by saying that they cannot confirm anything at the moment and asked fans to anticipate Taeyang’s activities..On January 1, Taeyang who is currently a free agent, not having signed with anyone for his solo activities as he continues to be with YG Entertainment for any content related to BIGBANG, shared a rare update on his Instagram account.2 photos were shared with a caption of the hashtag #2023.In black and white, 2 people could be seen in the photos, their backs to the camera.While one could easily be spotted as Taeyang himself, the other one was not tagged....Fans went into action and soon began investigating every detail of the photo.The other person seemed to be Jimin, as his hands, fluffy hair, and earrings seem to match the BTS member.Though no official announcement was made from either side, it seems that the singers have decided to give a green signal from their ends.Taeyang is rumoured to have been preparing for a January 2023 comeback so it seems as though we can expect the reports any time now.Once confirmed, this could very well be the biggest release of the year and one of the most hyped collaborations in K-pop history!.Meanwhile, BIGBANG’s G-Dragon also announced that he is working on an album and hopes to release it in 2023 .Stay updated with the latest Hallyu news on: Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.ALSO READ: BTS’ J-Hope, TXT wow at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve: 5 highlights from their stages'"
